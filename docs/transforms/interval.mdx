# Interval transform


There’s also an [**interval** scale option](../features/scales.md#scale-transforms) for quantizing continuous data.
The **interval transform** turns a quantitative or temporal *value* into a continuous extent [*start*, *stop*]. For example, if *value* is an instant in time, the interval transform could return a *start* of UTC midnight and a *stop* of the UTC midnight the following day.

The interval transform is often used for time-series bar charts. For example, consider the chart below of the daily trade volume of Apple stock. Because of the [barY mark](../marks/bar.md), the *x* scale is ordinal (*band*). And because the regularity of the data is not specified (*i.e.*, because Plot has no way of knowing that this is daily data), every distinct value must have its own label, leading to crowding. If a day were missing data, it would be difficult to spot! 👓

<Plot marginBottom={80} x={{type: "band"}}>
  y={{
    transform: (d) => d / 1e6,
    label: "Daily trade volume (millions)"
  }}>
  <BarY data={aapl.slice(-40)} x="Date" y="Volume" />
  <RuleY data={[0]} />
</Plot>

In contrast, a [rectY mark](../marks/rect.md) with the **interval** option and the *day* interval produces a temporal (*utc*) *x* scale. This allows Plot to compute ticks at meaningful intervals: here weekly boundaries, UTC midnight on Sundays. Furthermore, we can see that this isn’t truly daily data — it’s missing weekends and holidays when the stock market was closed.

<Plot y={{
    grid: true,
    transform: (d) => d / 1e6,
    label: "Daily trade volume (millions)"
  }}>
  <RectY data={aapl.slice(-40)} x="Date" interval="day" y="Volume" />
  <RuleY data={[0]} />
</Plot>


The interval transform is not a standalone transform, but an option on marks and scales.
The meaning of the **interval** mark option depends on the associated mark, such as line, bar, rect, or dot. For example, for the [barY mark](../marks/bar.md), the **interval** option affects converts a singular *y* value into an interval [*y1*, *y2*]. In the contrived example below, notice that the vertical↕︎ extent of each bar spans an interval of 5 million, rather than extending to *y* = 0.

<Plot marginBottom={80} x={{type: "band"}}>
  y={{
    grid: true,
    transform: (d) => d / 1e6,
    label: "Daily trade volume (millions)"
  }}>
  <BarY data={aapl.slice(-40)} x="Date" y="Volume" interval={5e6} />
  <RuleY data={[0]} />
</Plot>

While the **interval** option is most commonly specified as a named time interval or a number, it can also be specified as a [D3 time interval](https://d3js.org/d3-time#_interval) or any object that implements *interval*.floor and *interval*.offset.
