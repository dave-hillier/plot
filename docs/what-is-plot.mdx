# What is Plot?

**Replot** is a free, open-source, JavaScript library for visualizing tabular data, focused on accelerating exploratory data analysis. It has a concise, memorable, yet expressive interface, featuring [scales](./features/scales.md) and [layered marks](./features/marks.md) in the *grammar of graphics* style popularized by [Leland Wilkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Wilkinson) and [Hadley Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham) and inspired by the earlier ideas of [Jacques Bertin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Bertin). And there are [plenty of examples](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-gallery) to learn from and copy-paste.

Plot offers two APIs: a concise **imperative API** for vanilla JavaScript environments and a **declarative React component API** for building charts with JSX. Both APIs share the same powerful core — D3 scales, transforms, projections, and mark types — so you get the same expressive visualizations regardless of which API you choose. See the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) for details on both approaches.

In the spirit of *show don’t tell*, here’s a scatterplot of body measurements of athletes from the [2016 Summer Olympics](https://flother.is/2017/olympic-games-data/).

<Plot color={{legend: true}}>
  <Dot data={olympians} x="weight" y="height" stroke="sex" />
</Plot>

A plot specification assigns columns of data (*weight*, *height*, and *sex*) to visual properties of marks (**x**, **y**, and **stroke**). Plot does the rest! You can configure much more, if needed, but Plot’s goal is to help you get a meaningful visualization quickly to accelerate analysis.

This scatterplot suffers from overplotting: many dots are drawn in the same spot, so it’s hard to perceive density. We can fix this by applying a [bin transform](./transforms/bin.md) to group athletes of similar height and weight (and sex), and then use opacity to encode the number of athletes in the bin.

<Plot>
  <Rect data={olympians} {...bin({fillOpacity: "count"}, {x: "weight", y: "height", fill: "sex", inset: 0})} />
</Plot>

Or we could try the [density mark](./marks/density.md).

<Plot>
  <Density data={olympians} x="weight" y="height" stroke="sex" />
</Plot>

A simpler take on this data is to focus on one dimension: weight. We can use the bin transform again to make a histogram with weight on the *x*-axis and frequency on the *y*-axis. This plot uses a [rect mark](./marks/rect.md) and an implicit [stack transform](./transforms/stack.md).

<Plot>
  <RectY data={olympians} {...binX({y: "count"}, {x: "weight", fill: "sex"})} />
</Plot>

Or if we’d prefer to show the two distributions separately as small multiples, we can [facet](./features/facets.md) the data along *y* (keeping the *fill* encoding for consistency, and adding grid lines and a rule at *y* = 0 to improve readability).

<Plot grid>
  <RectY data={olympians} {...binX({y: "count"}, {x: "weight", fill: "sex", fy: "sex"})} />
  <RuleY data={[0]} />
</Plot>

## What can Plot do?

Because marks are composable, and because you can extend Plot with custom marks, you can make almost anything with it — much more than the charts above! The following [tree diagram](./marks/tree.md) of the documentation gives a sense of what’s ”in the box” with Plot. Peruse our [gallery of examples](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-gallery) for more inspiration.
